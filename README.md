# Angular Assignments

This is a project and assignment completion repository of my attempt for the Udemy course:
#### [Angular - The Complete Guide (2024 Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/)

## Assignment Layout

All assignment components are stored under the folder prefixed with the `assignment-x` where `x` represents the assignment number.
Assignment for each project can also be tracked based on the branch `feat/assignment-x`.

## Run the application

Run `ng serve` to show the local application at `http://localhost:4200/`.
